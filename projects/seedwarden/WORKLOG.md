## Session: 2026-04-13 — Wild Edibles Habit Photos

### Status update

The "0/18 complete" counter in the prior task description was stale. PROJECTS.md (Session 74) confirmed all 120+ native-plants images are downloaded and cached under `projects/seedwarden/scripts/images/native-plants/`. Actual count as of this session: **129 images** (including all 18 wild edibles and additional species).

Both Stellaria media and Taraxacum officinale images were already present as valid JPEG files (~960KB each) downloaded via the Wikipedia REST API in Session 74.

### Images logged this session

## Image sourcing: full native-plants set

All 129 images in `scripts/images/native-plants/` were sourced via:
1. Wikipedia REST API summary endpoint (`https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/[Article]`) — returns curated main article image, typically high quality botanical photograph.
2. iNaturalist API fallback for species where Wikipedia lacked a usable image (CC0 and CC-BY research-grade observations, sorted by votes).

Source: `scripts/download_plant_images.py`. Session 74 verified all 129 files are valid JPEGs.

## Content note: guide cross-references

The native-plants-regional-guide.md has a "More from Seedwarden" section (lines 7727-7735) with 3 cross-links. The product-audit recommends expanding to 2-3 links minimum — current 3 links meets the minimum. Regional cross-reference expansion (thin "see Northeast entry" stubs) is tracked separately in fix_guide.py output.

**Southwest region is thin**: 14 entries vs. 27-46 in all other regions. Flagged for content expansion in a future session.
