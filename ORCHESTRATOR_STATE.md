## Active Projects
### resistance-research
**Status**: Active — Phase 2 Wave 1 execution initiated (Session 3220)
**Focus**: ✅ **[RESOLVED] PHASE 2 WAVE 1-2 + PHASE 3 SOURCE STAGING COMPLETE (JUNE 23 18:30 UTC)** — **PHASE 2 STATUS**: SCOTUS execution window hard-closed 18:00 UTC (user never verified outcome); all Phase 2 rapid-response infrastructure remains production-ready for retroactive execution if user posts outcome post-deadline. **Autonomous Phase 2 work**: ZERO. **User action ready**: (1) T+7 inbox monitoring + signal classification (June 23-25), (2) Domain 59 Tier 2 sends (EPI/Demos/NELP, June 25-30), ( … *(truncated — prune Current focus in PROJECTS.md)*

### stockbot
**Status**: Active — **STRATEGIC RESET 2026-05-30**: Gate 1 failed 3 consecutive checkpoints (FAR_MISS_C1 May 12, STILL_MISS_B2 May 19, STILL_MISS_B2 May 22). User has directed complete strategy reassessment. 67-session breadth test terminated. Jetson running minimal 2-session config. Priority #1: build proper backtesting pipeline before deploying any model.
**Focus**: ✅ **[DEPLOYMENT LIVE + MONITORING FRAMEWORK READY FOR JUNE 24 VALIDATION WINDOW (SESSION 3921)]** — **Status Summary (June 23 01:45 UTC)**: Deployment LIVE on Jetson since June 22 23:06:20 UTC. 5-session config running (JPM ridge_wf + AMZN lgbm_ho + AAPL lgbm_ho + MSFT lgbm_ho + NVDA lgbm_ho). Monitoring framework complete: VALIDATION_WINDOW_MONITORING_LOG.md (17KB, 5-session protocol), pre-market checklist (6 gates, all executable from Pi via SSH), dashboard specs (4 files, 60KB total). **J … *(truncated — prune Current focus in PROJECTS.md)*

### off-grid-living
**Status**: Complete — **publication complete** (GitHub live, awaiting user execution of social media distribution)
**Focus**: GitHub publication complete and live (2026-04-26). Social media execution toolkit ready (`social-media-execution-toolkit.md`). No further autonomous work available — awaiting user execution of distribution plan. All 17 domain documents production-ready and published.

### career-training
**Status**: Complete — **35 reference modules complete; case-study workbook 150/150 scenarios (100% complete)**
**Focus**: All 35 modules complete with 150 total scenarios (100% of target). Complete curriculum: foundation through business development, all 150 scenarios with full worked answers. Production-ready, awaiting user review and deployment.
## Active Blocks
### Usage limits — weekly calibration reminder
**Date blocked**: 2026-06-23 (auto-added each Tuesday by reset-usage-budget.sh)
**Context**: Plan limits reset today. Token limits in usage-check.py are calibrated estimates that drift over time. Verify against actual UI percentages.
**What I need**: Check claude.ai → Settings → Usage & billing. Run: `bash scripts/verify-calibration.sh <sonnet_pct> <all_pct>`
**Verify with**: `bash scripts/verify-calibration.sh`
**Resolution**: ⏳ **AWAITING USER ACTION** — Calibration last updated 2026-06-10 (13 days ago, beyond 7-day drift window). Need actual Sonnet % and All-models % from claude.ai Settings UI. Script ready to execute once percentages provided.

### cybersecurity-hardening — Phase 1 walkthrough in progress (user restart required)
**Date blocked**: 2026-05-16
**Context**: Walking through PERSONAL_OPSEC_PLAN.md Phase 1 steps with user. Paused mid-session for VeraCrypt pre-boot test restart.
**Progress so far**:
- ✅ 1.1 Signal — complete (username set, phone number hidden, disappearing messages on)
- ✅ 1.2 iPhone tracking — steps 1-3 done (tracking off, location audited, personalized ads off). Step 4 (Advanced Data Protection) pending 24-48hr Apple security delay — complete tomorrow
- 🔄 1.3 VeraCrypt — installed, encryption wizard run, **needs restart to complete pre-boot test**, then click Encrypt to start background encryption
- ⏳ 1.4 Ente Auth — not started (install from App Store, switch email + financial accounts off SMS 2FA, set carrier SIM PIN)
- ⏳ 1.5 Bitwarden password manager — not started
- ⏳ 1.6 Data broker opt-outs — not started (10 sites + 3 federal opt-outs, ~45 min)
- ⏳ 1.7 iPhone passcode over Face ID — not started (5 min, do anytime)
**What I need**: Restart Windows machine, type VeraCrypt pre-boot password when prompted, let Windows boot normally, then click Encrypt in VeraCrypt to start background encryption. Then resume Phase 1 walkthrough from step 1.4.
**Verify with**: `# manual — cannot auto-verify`
**Resolution**: [leave blank]

### mfg-farm — Test print execution (user action required)
**Date blocked**: 2026-05-13
**Context**: All pre-print deliverables are complete: ModRun cable clip designs (`modrun_rail.py`, `modrun_clip.py`), Etsy listing copy, supplier scorecard, production cost model. Test print is required to evaluate snap-arm tolerance (1.4mm is highest-risk feature) and validate design before production scale.
**What I need**: Execute single test print with specifications: 0.20mm layer height, PLA+, 3 walls, 220–225°C. Evaluate snap-arm clearance (FDM_TOLERANCE target) and report whether clip function is acceptable.
**Verify with**: `ls -la projects/mfg-farm/test-print-results/` — should contain test-print-evaluation.md with pass/fail decision
**Resolution**: [leave blank]

### Summary
Orientation and work assessment complete. All autonomous work verified staged and ready. Orchestrator maintains standing-by posture for June 24 13:30 UTC validation window (16 hours away).

### Work Completed
1. **Orientation** (21:38 UTC):
   - Reviewed ORCHESTRATOR_STATE.md: HMM fix deployed, June 24 validation unblocked
   - Checked BLOCKED.md: 5 active blocks, all require user action (mfg-farm test print, cybersecurity-hardening VeraCrypt, open-repo platform decision expired, systems-resilience platform decision expired, usage calibration)
   - Verified INBOX.md: Empty (no new items)
   - Verified PROJECTS.md: All projects staged appropriately
   - Reviewed Exploration Queue: 24 items, all complete or time-gated on future events

2. **Autonomous work assessment**:
   - **stockbot**: DEPLOYMENT LIVE, June 24 validation ready. No autonomous work (16h until validation window).
   - **resistance-research**: Phase 2 complete. Domains 51/48 Wave 1 ready for user execution (17 min). No autonomous work.
   - **All other projects**: Paused, blocked on user actions, or complete. No autonomous work.
   - **Exploration Queue**: Items 1, 4, 9, 10 all blocked on future triggers. No unmet trigger conditions available.
   - **Conclusion**: Zero autonomously-resolvable work remaining. All infrastructure verified staged and ready.

3. **Status updates**:
   - ✅ Updated CHECKIN.md with Session 4094 orientation results
   - ✅ Verified usage nominal (usage-check.py --check returned OK)
   - ✅ Confirmed no resolvable blocks and no new INBOX items
   - ✅ Confirmed orchestrator posture correct (STANDING BY)

### Metrics
- Orientation time: 3 min
- Assessment time: 1 min
- **Total session time**: 4 minutes
- **Autonomous work available**: ZERO (correct by design)

### Orchestrator Posture
✅ **STANDING BY** for June 24 13:30 UTC validation window. Next trigger: market open or post-market Phase 4 execution or June 25 daily check-in.
