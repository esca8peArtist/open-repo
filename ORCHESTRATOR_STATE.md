## Active Projects
### resistance-research
**Status**: Active — Phase 2 Wave 1 execution initiated (Session 3220)
**Focus**: ✅ **[PHASE 2 WAVE 1-2 FULLY VERIFIED & STAGED (SESSION 3748) — AWAITING USER COPY-PASTE EMAIL EXECUTION]** — **PHASE 2 WAVE 1-2 EXECUTION STATUS (SESSION 3748, June 17 05:24 UTC)**: 

### stockbot
**Status**: Active — **STRATEGIC RESET 2026-05-30**: Gate 1 failed 3 consecutive checkpoints (FAR_MISS_C1 May 12, STILL_MISS_B2 May 19, STILL_MISS_B2 May 22). User has directed complete strategy reassessment. 67-session breadth test terminated. Jetson running minimal 2-session config. Priority #1: build proper backtesting pipeline before deploying any model.
**Focus**: ✅ **[OPTION A DEPLOYED — VALIDATION MONITORING & ANALYSIS STAGED FOR JUNE 18]** — **Session 3835 (June 18 00:13 UTC)**: Pre-staging complete. Jetson health verified (5 sessions loaded, HMM masking active, zero blockers). **Monitoring staged**: `scripts/validate_june_18_window.py` created for hourly tracking during 13:30–20:00 UTC (Discord alerts at 14:15 UTC HMM prime, first trade, window close). **Analysis template staged**: `JUNE_18_VALIDATION_OUTCOME_REPORT.md` ready for fill-in at 20 … *(truncated — prune Current focus in PROJECTS.md)*

### off-grid-living
**Status**: Complete — **publication complete** (GitHub live, awaiting user execution of social media distribution)
**Focus**: GitHub publication complete and live (2026-04-26). Social media execution toolkit ready (`social-media-execution-toolkit.md`). No further autonomous work available — awaiting user execution of distribution plan. All 17 domain documents production-ready and published.

### career-training
**Status**: Complete — **35 reference modules complete; case-study workbook 150/150 scenarios (100% complete)**
**Focus**: All 35 modules complete with 150 total scenarios (100% of target). Complete curriculum: foundation through business development, all 150 scenarios with full worked answers. Production-ready, awaiting user review and deployment.
## Active Blocks

### cybersecurity-hardening — Phase 1 walkthrough in progress (user restart required)
**Date blocked**: 2026-05-16
**Context**: Walking through PERSONAL_OPSEC_PLAN.md Phase 1 steps with user. Paused mid-session for VeraCrypt pre-boot test restart.
**Progress so far**:
- ✅ 1.1 Signal — complete (username set, phone number hidden, disappearing messages on)
- ✅ 1.2 iPhone tracking — steps 1-3 done (tracking off, location audited, personalized ads off). Step 4 (Advanced Data Protection) pending 24-48hr Apple security delay — complete tomorrow
- 🔄 1.3 VeraCrypt — installed, encryption wizard run, **needs restart to complete pre-boot test**, then click Encrypt to start background encryption
- ⏳ 1.4 Ente Auth — not started (install from App Store, switch email + financial accounts off SMS 2FA, set carrier SIM PIN)
- ⏳ 1.5 Bitwarden password manager — not started
- ⏳ 1.6 Data broker opt-outs — not started (10 sites + 3 federal opt-outs, ~45 min)
- ⏳ 1.7 iPhone passcode over Face ID — not started (5 min, do anytime)
**What I need**: Restart Windows machine, type VeraCrypt pre-boot password when prompted, let Windows boot normally, then click Encrypt in VeraCrypt to start background encryption. Then resume Phase 1 walkthrough from step 1.4.
**Verify with**: `# manual — cannot auto-verify`
**Resolution**: [leave blank]
---
### mfg-farm — Test print execution (user action required)
**Date blocked**: 2026-05-13
**Context**: All pre-print deliverables are complete: ModRun cable clip designs (`modrun_rail.py`, `modrun_clip.py`), Etsy listing copy, supplier scorecard, production cost model. Test print is required to evaluate snap-arm tolerance (1.4mm is highest-risk feature) and validate design before production scale.
**What I need**: Execute single test print with specifications: 0.20mm layer height, PLA+, 3 walls, 220–225°C. Evaluate snap-arm clearance (FDM_TOLERANCE target) and report whether clip function is acceptable.
**Verify with**: `ls -la projects/mfg-farm/test-print-results/` — should contain test-print-evaluation.md with pass/fail decision
**Resolution**: [leave blank]

### open-repo — June 12 deployment never executed; infrastructure missing on raspby1
**Date blocked**: 2026-06-16 (discovered in Session 3671 audit)
**Original failure date**: 2026-06-12 (deployment date when nothing occurred)
**Context**: The June 12 deployment was incorrectly marked as "resolved" in Session 2995, which only clarified the start time (09:00 UTC). The actual deployment never executed. **AUDIT VERIFIED (Session 3682, 15:50–16:45 UTC)** — Three production-ready audit documents confirm deployment DID NOT execute:
- DEPLOYMENT_JUNE_12_OUTCOME_VERIFICATION.md (204 lines): Verified 0/6 infrastructure checks pass; Docker completely empty; no Nginx, PostgreSQL, API runtime, TLS certs; all endpoints return HTTP 000 (connection refused); confidence 99%
- POST_DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES_ASSESSMENT.md (127 lines): 6 prioritized blockers identified; root cause = platform/runtime decision expired June 15 23:59 UTC with no user response
- DEPLOYMENT_JUNE_12_OUTCOME_VERIFICATION.md (204 lines, Session 3770): 0/6 infrastructure checks pass; Docker completely empty; no Nginx, PostgreSQL, API runtime, TLS certs; all endpoints return HTTP 000; confidence 99%
