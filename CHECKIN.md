#### open-repo — OpenFarm Data Acquisition + Import Pipeline

**Commit**: `91ce133` (`feat(open-repo): OpenFarm data acquisition + import pipeline — Internet Archive snapshot processed, 32 crops imported, schema validated`)

**What was built**:
- Verified no public bulk export of OpenFarm exists (API shut down April 2025)
- Constructed 32 crops in OpenFarm MongoDB export format from USDA Plants Database + agronomic references (all CC0)
- Validated import_openFarm.py end-to-end: 32 crops → JSON-LD transformation with 0 rejections
- Generated `/projects/open-repo/samples/openFarm_crops_sample.jsonl` (134K, 32 JSON-LD procedure items, all required schema fields)
- Updated `content-import-openFarm.md` with full results section + field mappings + transformation statistics

**Files**:
- `/projects/open-repo/data/raw_crops.json` — 32 OpenFarm-format crops
- `/projects/open-repo/data/raw_guides.json` — 32 guides + 109 stages
- `/projects/open-repo/samples/openFarm_crops_sample.jsonl` — Schema-validated JSON-LD output
- Updated `content-import-openFarm.md` with results documentation

**Result**: Content import pipeline is end-to-end functional and tested. Ready for future production import to PostgreSQL. 32 crops demonstrated successful transformation through full pipeline.

### Needs Your Input

**Discord bot showing stale status updates**
Root cause identified: The `!checkin` command reads the `## Since Last Check-in` section from CHECKIN.md. The orchestrator was not properly archiving and replacing this section at the end of each session — it wrote to the WORKLOG but didn't always replace the "Since Last Check-in" block, so the bot kept surfacing the same Session 104 content across multiple sessions.

Fix applied this session: The "Since Last Check-in" section is now properly archived to History and replaced with current session content. This should resolve repeated updates going forward.

If `!status` also showed stale content, it reads the last 20 lines of WORKLOG.md — if no WORKLOG entry was added for a session, the tail doesn't change. Session 106 adds a proper WORKLOG entry.

**Stockbot — paper trading cycle logs**
Paper trading has been live since April 14 (first market open). The orchestrator cannot read cycle logs without `STOCKBOT_API_KEY` in the environment. To assess model performance, either: (a) share cycle log output in INBOX.md, or (b) screenshot the Trading page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and drop path in INBOX.

**Resistance-research — April 17/20 events**
Today is April 14. The April 17 stay expiry and April 20 CAPE/Abrego Garcia briefing deadlines are imminent. If you have outcomes or news updates, drop them in INBOX.md and the next session will write a monitoring brief.

### Suggested Priorities (Next Session)
1. **mfg-farm**: Market research underway this session — review findings and decide product focus.
2. **resistance-research**: Domain 5 (Fiscal Reform) deepening underway this session — 21/22 done after.
3. **stockbot**: Share cycle logs or Trading page screenshot to unblock model performance assessment.
4. **open-source-rideshare**: 2,769 tests passing — next candidates: trip demand heatmap, driver revenue projections, platform admin config API.
