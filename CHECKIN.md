    - NVRA quiet period (Aug 7) requires 6-8 weeks for institutional adoption → April launch essential
    - DOJ consent decree clock (May 30) needs 30+ days prep → Path B loses this window
    - Spring legislative sessions (AZ, OH, NE) adjorn early-to-mid May → April launch captures bills, May launch misses
    - FISA 702 expiration (April 30) is natural institutional hook for distribution
  - **Path A viable** if user has direct election protection org relationships
  - **Path B not recommended** — loses all four critical 2026 timing windows
  - All analysis committed to resistance-research submodule
- ✅ WORKLOG.md updated with Session 576 work
- ✅ Committed to master (dea70c4)

2. **resistance-research distribution path** ← **ANALYSIS NOW AVAILABLE** (Path A+37 recommended)
   - File: `projects/resistance-research/DISTRIBUTION_PATH_ANALYSIS.md`
   - Decision triggers Phase 1 institutional distribution immediately
   - Tier 1 targets: 25 high-leverage contacts (senators, think tanks, law schools)
   - Timeline: Send by April 30 to capture institutional adoption windows

3. **mfg-farm test print** (user action anytime)

   - Test print validates CadQuery designs → triggers supplier negotiation
   
4. **seedwarden Phase 1 launch** (user action anytime)
   - 3 tag corrections + Etsy verification → 21 products ready to list

**Recommended Next Actions**:
1. **IMMEDIATE (next 2h 50min)**: Restart stockbot engine OR confirm it's already running

   - If no process found, run: `cd projects/stockbot && .venv/bin/python scripts/run_live_trading.py &`
2. **ANYTIME**: Review `DISTRIBUTION_PATH_ANALYSIS.md` and select Path A, A+37, or B
   - If A+37 (recommended): Phase 1 execution within 48 hours (user personalization + agent setup)

## Previous Session (Session 564 — 2026-04-28 05:34–07:45 UTC — Phase 3 Candidates 5-7 COMPLETE + Market Open Ready)

**Status**: 🟢 **PHASE 3 RESEARCH COMPLETE** — Session 564 executed 3 deep resistance-research projects in parallel/sequential waves, delivering 24,473 words of production-ready Phase 3 expansion content. All code infrastructure verified production-ready for market open. Stockbot awaiting user engine restart (T-5h 45min).

**Autonomous Work Completed**:

1. ✅ **resistance-research: Phase 3 Candidate 5 — Finance & Fiscal Architecture** (8,667 words, 15+ sources)
   - **Commit**: `aa57dca`
   - **Key Findings**: Self-enforcing vs. will-dependent fiscal mechanisms taxonomy; Mexico judicial-fiscal feedback loop (12-18 month consequence cycle); 5 US reform pathways (IRS Independence Act → Tax Enforcement Restoration Act); post-*Loper Bright* statutory enforceability analysis

2. ✅ **resistance-research: Phase 3 Candidate 6 — Democratic Participation & Election Security** (8,006 words, 50 sources)
   - **Commit**: `d37dada`
   - **Key Findings**: Election security/participation trilemma false (paper ballots more secure AND more accessible); certification refusal is novel structural threat; Colorado RLA key state model; AVR turnout paradox resolves at net level; FEC operationally dead (quorum vacancy); post-*Loper Bright* reforms need private right of action for durability
   - **Status**: Production-ready for Phase 1 institutional distribution

3. ✅ **resistance-research: Phase 3 Candidate 7 — Technology Governance & Digital Rights** (7,800 words, 50 sources)
   - **Commit**: `ee93d69`
   - **Key Findings**: Innovation/rights trilemma false; WISeR diagnostic accountability failure case; Section 702 FISA unresolved (April 30 deadline); Canada AIDA shows enforcement design failure; post-*Loper Bright* requires EU AI Act specificity; post-quantum crypto transition bipartisan and achievable; data broker loophole is Fourth Amendment + First Amendment + election security issue
   - **Status**: Production-ready for Phase 1 institutional distribution

4. ✅ **Stockbot: Market Open Readiness Checklist** — Quick reference guide for pre-restart verification, engine start command, market open window expectations, post-market monitoring
   - **File**: `projects/stockbot/MARKET_OPEN_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` (locally created, untracked)

5. ✅ **Stockbot: Post-Market Monitoring Guide** — Comprehensive monitoring procedures for first trading cycle, hourly checks, daily summary, troubleshooting, success metrics

**Session Metrics**:
- **Autonomous output**: 24,473 words (3 research projects)
- **Sources**: 115+ (15 + 50 + 50)
- **Agents spawned**: 3 (1 sequential Phase 3-5, 2 parallel Phase 3-6/7)
- **Commits to master**: 3 research documents (aa57dca, d37dada, ee93d69) + 1 orchestration (c1485f8)
- **New blocks created**: 0
- **Token usage**: ~210K tokens (parallel execution efficient)

**Project Status Summary**:

| Project | Status | Blocker | Next Action |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **resistance-research** | Phase 1-5 complete, Phase 3-5/6/7 complete | User distribution path decision (A/A+37/B) | Execute Phase 1 institutional outreach once user decides |
| **stockbot** | Code production-ready, all tests passing | User engine restart (T-5h 45min) | Monitor market open, execute first trades, verify P&L |
| **seedwarden** | Track A blocked on tag corrections; Track B complete | User tag corrections + Etsy verification | Phase 1 upload once user completes tags |
| **mfg-farm** | Business plan + designs complete | Physical test print | Supplier negotiation once print validated |
| **cybersecurity-hardening** | All distribution prep complete | User Tier 1 template review | Execute Tier 1 institutional outreach |
| **open-repo** | PR #1 open on GitHub | External code review | Merge once approved |
| **off-grid-living** | Publication complete | User social media execution | Distribute to target channels |
| **workout** | Comprehensive plan complete | User review + selection | Implementation planning |
| **open-source-rideshare** | Paused | Project pause | Resume when user ready |

**Critical Deadline**:
- **[🚨 CRITICAL: T-5h 45min remaining]** Stockbot engine restart required by **13:30 UTC TODAY (2026-04-28)** — US market open
  ```bash
  cd projects/stockbot && .venv/bin/python scripts/run_live_trading.py &
  ```
  All code verified production-ready. Engine will load 5-ticker portfolio, execute paper trading, fire Discord notifications and alerts.

**Needs Your Input**:

1. **[CRITICAL: Due 13:30 UTC, 5h 45min remaining]** Restart stockbot engine
   - Command: `cd projects/stockbot && .venv/bin/python scripts/run_live_trading.py &`
   - Expected: Engine initializes, waits for market open at 13:30 UTC, executes first trading cycle
   - Monitoring: Use `POST_MARKET_MONITORING.md` after 13:30 UTC to track first trades

2. **[HIGH: Decision needed]** Confirm resistance-research Phase 1 distribution path:
   - **Path A**: Immediate distribution (conservative, proven model)
   - **Path A+37 Hybrid**: Path A + Domain 37 (Federal Executive Interference in 2026 Midterms) — recommended for timeliness
   - **Path B**: Continue optional Phase 3 research before Phase 1 launch
   - **Impact**: All 3 Phase 3 candidates (5, 6, 7) production-ready and waiting; Phase 1 institutional outreach can begin immediately once decision made

3. **[MEDIUM: Action needed]** Mfg-farm test print
   - Required: Physical test print of CadQuery designs (rail + clip) to validate printability
   - Next: Supplier negotiation immediately after print validation

4. **[OPTIONAL: For redundancy]** Set `STOCKBOT_DISCORD_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` env var
   - Enables real-time CRITICAL alerts (drawdown, regime shift, circuit breaker) separate from position notifications
   - If not set: daily summary still fires at 20:00 UTC

**Next Session Actions** (awaiting user input):

1. **BEFORE 13:30 UTC**: If stockbot engine not restarted, escalate immediately — market open is critical deadline
2. **AT 13:30 UTC**: If engine restarted, begin post-market monitoring (use POST_MARKET_MONITORING.md):
   - Watch first trading cycle (13:30–14:30 UTC)
   - Verify signals generating, trades executing, Discord notifications firing
   - Check for errors (feature count mismatch, ticker mismatch, shape errors)
3. **AT 20:00 UTC**: Verify daily Discord summary fired successfully
4. **Post-market (after first trade data)**: Execute Exploration Queue Item 3 (Stockbot post-Gate-2 operations analysis)
5. **Once resistance-research path decided**: Execute Phase 1 distribution pre-launch checklist

**Exploration Queue Status**:
- ✅ Phase 3 Candidate 5 (Finance & Fiscal Architecture) — COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 3 Candidate 6 (Democratic Participation & Election Security) — COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 3 Candidate 7 (Technology Governance & Digital Rights) — COMPLETE
- ⏳ Stockbot: Post-Gate-2 Operations & Live Trading Scaling (queued, unblocked after engine restarts + first market data)
